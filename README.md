# Weather-App
We will make a web application to check out the weather forecast for the current day. 
We will use an API to fetch real-time data and then we add it to our application.
By using this "https://openweathermap.org/api" website and creating the account we can fetch the api key.
So that we can add that api key in our script code which shows the curent locations temperature,humidity,wind.
In this after entering the location it shows the temperature in Â°c, humidity and the wind speed in km/h.
If we enter the wrong city name it shows as Invalid city name.
